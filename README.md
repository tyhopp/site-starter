# Site Starter

A tiny, tiny site starter kit.

## What is this?

One HTML, CSS and Javascript file all linked together.

## Why?

Every time I want to test something in the browser I have the following three options:

- Open [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), but there's no asset uploading and the small panels are hard to work with as I write more code. 
- Google "HTML Boilerplate" only to find giant boilerplate templates, each with their own set of opinionated things included. 
- Create the files from scratch and fill in the basic elements. 

I almost always choose the third. This kit does that for you, just follow the steps below.

## How do you use this?

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/tyhopp/site-starter` from your terminal to download these files. 
2. Run `cd site-starter` to navigate into the project repository.
3. When inside the project directory, setup your local server. I recommend [MDN's suggested approach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server). To do this:
	- Run `python -V` to find out what Python version you have. If you don't have Python, [download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
	- If you have Python version 2+, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. 
	- If you have Python version 3+, run `python -m http.server`.
4. Open your browser and type `localhost:8000` in your address bar. You should be live!
5. Now you can open the files in a text editor, such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and write your HTML, CSS & JS. Just refresh your `localhost` site with CMD/CTRL + R, and your changes will show up instantaneously. Happy coding! ðŸ™Œ
